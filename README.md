# SimpleFileUpdater
Simple Installer/Updater for any files

FIRST, Run the install.bat which will download all required imports from the requirements.txt

This uses pastebin and your own choice of a file hoster like for example discord download links.
youre going to want to go to pastebin and create a paste with that file link, then grab the raw text link for it and replace
in the py file where it says rawpastebinlinks

yes i realize its messy code, it was basically an old updater that was temporary made for a different project.
